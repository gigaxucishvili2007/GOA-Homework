    <h1>Basketball was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a physical education instructor in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. Naismith developed the game to keep his students active indoors during the winter. The original game was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets as goals. Over time, basketball evolved, with the peach baskets replaced by metal hoops and backboards, and the introduction of a dedicated basketball.</h1>
    <h3>Rules of the Game
        Court Dimensions: A standard basketball court is rectangular, measuring 94 feet long and 50 feet wide. The hoop is 10 feet above the ground.</h3>
